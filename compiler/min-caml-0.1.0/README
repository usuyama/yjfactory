[2008/9/17]

- PowerPC is now supported (in addition to SPARC), thanks to
  Ms. Masuko and Prof. Asai in Ochanomizu University.  You _must_
  execute either ./to_ppc or ./to_sparc _before_ make.

- The register allocator now uses a simpler algorithm (earlyspill) by
  default.  Other files (latespill, nospill, notarget, ...) have been
  removed.
